    "Description": "Great for hard working hands in need of heavy duty repair...and also just generally awesome for dry skin all over.\n\nUse a small amount as often as required wherever you get dry skin. Absolutely gorgeous used as a facial moisturiser especially for very dry or sensitive skin - simply wash face with water, rub a tiny amount between hands first then gently massage into face while skin is still damp. Use in the morning for supple, hydrated skin all day long, or before bed for a super nourishing night treatment. It absorbs more readily into wet skin, so perfect for the whole body straight after a shower or after washing hands.\n\nWith a highly nourishing blend of organic olive, macadamia and sunflower oils infused with Aussie native, antioxidant-rich quandong, skin-soothing calendula and a deliciously refreshing blend of mandarin, kunzea and lavender essential oils this multi-use, rich, buttery balm is hands down The Best for repairing dry skin, and a little goes a long way.\n\nMacadamia oil has a chemical profile very similar to our own sebum, making this balm non-comodogenic and readily absorbed. Rich in phytosterols, linoleic, palmitoleic and oleic essential fatty acids - all important for promoting cell regeneration, preventing premature ageing and helping skin retain moisture.\n\nOlive oil is likewise great for skin in more ways than one, especially as a potent source of antioxidants which help skin fight free-radical damage. Raw unbleached beeswax does wonders to soothe and hydrate skin with its natural anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties as well as being an excellent barrier for reducing trans-epidermal water loss.\n\n60 or 120mL\nALL NATURAL\n100% AUSTRALIAN\n\nThis is a natural product with a limited shelf life. Please use within 24 months of purchase and store away from direct sun to prolong product life.",
