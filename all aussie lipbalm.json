As you warm the wax against your skin you'll notice the colour is somewhat buildable and shows up more intensely with heavier application. Colours in photo are faithful to real life product.\n\nTIP: The natural balm also works great as a barrier balm for all minor cuts, burns & abrasions - beeswax has natural antibacterial, antimicrobial and soothing qualities, while macadamia oil is a superhero when it comes to nourishing skin and helping it heal and regenerate.\n\n12mL\nALL INGREDIENTS 100% AUSTRALIAN",
